Crate
-----

Crate is an open source record crate for your iPhone.

It lets you organize, view, and play music from your iPod Library and Rdio together as one.

It is currently a work in progress and not yet functional.


Mayhem
------

At this point, I've got querying the iPod Library to a functional level, but it's a bit of a mess.
I haven't quite figured out a reasonable application architecture, and because I'm not yet sure how
I'm going to be caching data from Rdio (probably CoreData), I think I'm going to wait on making
any more architectural decisions until I've experimented with figuring out an MPQuery equivalent
for the Rdio data store.
