Crate
-----

Crate is an open source record crate for your iPhone.

It lets you organize, view, and play music from your iPod Library and Rdio together as one.

It is currently a work in progress and not yet functional.


Mayhem
------

Current status:
Listing artists, albums, and songs from MediaPlayer (iPod Library), and listing Artists from Rdio.

Your Rdio collection is cached from CoreData, but it'll probably be duplicated if your collection changes.  Not ideal, but hey, work in progress.
